# MPM406 - RCT notes
# 20130309 HCrockford
#

# all to prevent bias
random selection prevents selection bias
masking prevents observer bias.

use placebo or second treatment 
# placebo for physchological treatemtn
# or other treatment group

placebo must be as good as curretn treatemtn

howw to maximise comliance
make easy to take
easy pills
no side effect.
need to assess - biologic meaasure

table 1 - goups are similar on things you can measure, hx disease, bmi.

cox - time to event - person time is measured.
hazard - and compare hazard ratio
must use intetnion to treat rather than compliance.

need stopping rules
need to stop if outcome is clear each way - need to look at data mid way - peeks.
adjust p's for multiple looks - 
if know sig benefit/risk can continue?

factorial
two drugs, two placebos

sample size
how many rx groupd, ex frequensy - dichot/continous
two sided.

===========================
prior mp women protectd
post mp FSH up, E2 down

pre - normal monthly
peri - not monthly, but last less than one year
post - none for 1 year

assume all e2's and p4s are same

if have uterus need p4 and e2, if no uterus just e2
	most often take e and p daily together - e alone puts at risk

Route
non oral re
transdermal

need to consider each womens individual risk factors

goal reduce fractures BMS, with minimal risk ar lowest dose and proper time intiate

indicators 

interactions
some people benefit vs others

# assignemtn
#
# use email bot? phon ebot - compare assigned to actual reported.
# # using atmospheric random numbe rgenerator
#
# two by two factorial to assess time and dose?
#
# validate compliance - make sure taking w blood test - tolerance?
# # small sample?
#
# need blind/placebo start at same time?
# # give all participants vitamins, some estrogen - ethics?
# # send out packs of pills so no dr/.nurse knows if rx or not.
# ## chack cant tell diff w consumer trial.
# 
## can all start at same time and swap treatments to e2 at diff times.
#side efects of rx unmask - bleed?
#mask data analyst too
#
#flowchart like in lecture slides - clintrial shrt
